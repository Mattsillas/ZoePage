          <h2>The Biological Swing</h2>
          <p class="regular-color">
            Zoe loves when both of us hold her hands at the same time, because she loves to swing back and forth. We are somewhat concerned about doing it so much because we read that it can be harmful to a toddlers shoulders and elbows. So we don't do it very often,
            but whenever we do, she absolutely loves it! Maybe it's okay to be a little dangerous every now and again.

            <h2>The Fog, The Mist, The Buns!</h2>
            <p class="regular-color">
              One of our favorite memories of little Zoe was the day we took this picture. It was around 8-o-clock in the morning, and there was a gentle fog all over the ground. Zoe stared at it with wonder and joy, it was the first time she had encountered fog up
              close. Seeing her experience things for the first time will forever be a treasure in our hearts as parents.

          <h2>Living the Dream</h2>
          <p class="regular-color">
            Zoe is completely attached to her mother, and we just love that about her. She loves to spend time with dad, sure. However it always seems to be mom who she reaches for whenever things aren't quite right. One thing we love about her is how independent
            she is for a toddler, but mom loves nothing more than when Zoe decides she wants to cuddle. Those times are in short supply, being that Zoe is a brave adventurer and would rather be off accomplishing some great feat. Whenever it happens, it's
            what we call "living the dream."

          <h2>Never Looking Back</h2>
          <p class="regular-color">
            Becoming parents was not something we had initially planned for at such a young age, though now we couldn't even imagine life without Zoe! It's so fascinating how life can change forever in an instant. She is such a bundle of fun, and seeing her grow
            and learn every single day is truly a privelege. Being parents is definitely a challenge at times, but neither of us would trade parenthood for anything. Zoe is our world now, and to us that is beautiful.

http://i.imgur.com/IBRnMN5.jpg   //  //  Zoe is 2 years old, loves to jump and explore. Her favorite things include putting her shoes on by herself, trying to strap on her swimming cap over and over again, and her stuffed
cat, Mufasa. She prefers apple juice over orange juice, sausages over hotdogs, and mommys phone over daddys phone. She is still quite new to the world, but struts about like it's hers to conquer. She may not have much impact and the society
around her, but she has completely changed the lives of her Mom and Dad, in the best way possible!-->
